Developing a method to spot anomalies in a large, dynamic knowledge graph can be a complex task, but there are steps you can follow to build such a system. Below is a high-level outline of a method and interactions using the Swiss AI LLM models to create a natural human interaction interface:

### 1. Dataset Preparation

- **Graph Representation**: Represent your knowledge graph using a suitable structure such as adjacency lists, edge lists, or even leveraging graph databases like Neo4j or more general graph data modeling tools. Each node and edge should ideally have a timestamp that indicates when the change was made (or when the object was created/last updated).

- **Short Term Data**: For training and testing, you could focus on short-term time slices (e.g., daily, weekly) to account for reasonable evolution patterns.

### 2. Temporal Anomaly Detection

#### Approach: **Evolution Graph Modeling

- **Evolution Graph Construction**: 
  - Construct a graph where each node and edge has a time stamp. This graph represents how your knowledge graph evolves over time. One could use a dynamic graph or represent it as a series of snapshots where each snapshot is a separate static graph.
  - For a truly dynamic approach where each change is recorded as a time-stamped event, you might maintain a timeseries of graph snapshots (with edges and nodes at particular times), which are then considered as a dynamic graph over time.

#### **Anomaly Detection on Evolution Graph**
There are several methods to detect anomalies on a dynamic graph:

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**: They can learn spatial and temporal dependencies in node attributes or edge structures. For temporal anomalies, you can extend GCNs to see how node and edge attributes evolve over time.
  - For edge-level anomalies, you might look at the evolution of edge weights or, if available, attribute data associated with edges.
  - For node-level anomalies, the approach could look at how node attributes change over time compared to typical behavior or across similar nodes.

- **Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (TGCNs)**: These are specialized for handling dynamic graphs, focusing on the evolution of node attributes (e.g., changes in a nodeâ€™s degree distribution, or its connections) and edge attributes (e.g., changes in edge types) over time.

- **For time-series-like data, you can also consider Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to process the graph evolution sequentially. An LSTM, for example, could model the sequence of graph updates and anomaly scores would be anomalies in this sequence (e.g., a sudden change in the rate of node creations or edge removals).

- **Anomaly Detection in Graphs**: 
  - You could also apply classical anomaly detection techniques like One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Isolation Forest, but this might require some feature engineering to represent the graph evolution as numerical features that can be fed into such algorithms.

  - For more complex structures, yours could explore newer methods like Graph Autoencoders to learn a compressed representation of the graph and then use reconstruction error or KL-divergence between predicted reconstructions and actual graphs to identify anomalies (note: this is primarily for broader graph structure anomalies).

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Most methods abovementioned can be adapted for unsupervised learning. The key is to structure your data to have a well-defined "normal" or "baseline" performance (e.g. by computing features or baselines based on historical data or known patterns), and then detect deviations from that baseline as anomalies.

### 3. LLM Interface

To interact with complex graph analytics tasks naturally, you could use a Large Language Model with capabilities like:

- **Conversational Querying and Exploration**: Users query observations or queries like "show me nodes with sudden significant changes in connection patterns in the last week" and the LLM could interpret this to extract relevant graph features and run relevant anomaly detection algorithms.

- **Graph Feature Interpretation**: For complex graph structures or anomaly scores, the LLM could help interpret what the learned features (from GCNs, TGCNs, etc.) mean in terms of network behavior, helping engineers understand the anomalies.

- **Example Chat Interaction**:
  > User: "What could be causing the unusual increase in new connections between nodes in the core network over the past two weeks?"
  > Model: "From our model, this sudden spike might indicate either a new network service being deployed, or an underlying issue with network stability. I recommend looking at the node types involved and recent changes in their attributes."

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Start by conceiving how to represent graph evolution (e.g., nodes and edges over time). Then, extract temporal features relevant for your specific anomalies (e.g., change rates, time-series for node attributes, event types, etc.).

2. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose a suitable approach (GCNs for node/edge-attributed changes, TGCNs for dynamic changes, or time-series approaches if applicable) and train it on your data. Since we're working unsupervised, might need creative ways to define a baseline or use techniques like Statistical Process Control (SPC) for anomaly detection.

3. **Anomaly Scoring**:
   - **Self-Attention Networks or Graph Convolutional Networks with an anomaly score head**: Use the learned graph representations to output a score indicating likelihood of anomaly at either node/edge/graph levels. 
   - **Interpretation with LLM**: High scores or significant deviations from baseline can be highlighted in the chat interface with explanations or recommendations (using the LLM to translate complex model outputs into human-readable insights).

## Example Use Cases
- **Infra Monitoring**: Identify sudden changes in network architecture or unexpected node connectivity that could indicate a reconfiguration or possible fault.
  
- **Service Entitlement**: Detect fake or incorrect service assignments based on historical patterns of service provision and associated user or node attributes.

- **Cellular Network Optimization**: In a cellular network, anomalies might indicate cell tower malfunctions or sudden, unusual user behavior patterns that require immediate attention.

## Challenges and Next Steps

- **Scalability**: With 200 million nodes, real-time or near real-time processing will be complex. You might need distributed computing or optimized graph data structures (e.g., graph databases with efficient update mechanisms).

- **Interpretability**: Especially with unsupervised methods, translating machine learning output into actionable information is critical. Integrating LLM for this will help significantly, but you may also need to layer on domain knowledge (network topology, typical network changes) to give more context.

- **Testing and Validation**: Start with a small-scale pilot to validate your approach, including both the technical feasibility (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch for models, etc.) and the effectiveness of the LLM-based interface in communicating insights to network engineers.

- **Error / False Positive Management**: Any system will produce false positives (e.g., due to normal, expected changes in a young service or due to not accounting for scheduled maintenance). A good interface will offer insights into the anomaly score's confidence and log past transformations to help engineers understand the underlying reasons and filter out non-issues.

This is a broad outline due to the complexity of your task. Each of these steps could benefit from deeper dive into literature for more sophisticated models (especially if graph structure evolves in complex, high-dimensional ways) or from direct application to your dataset's unique attributes and evolution patterns. 

If you're open to a more refined or targeted approach basis more detailed discussions or specific data characteristics, please provide more context or clarify key aspects like the nature of the knowledge graph, typical graph changes, and real-world use case priorities (e.g., infrastructure monitoring vs. service discovery). 

Lastly, since you mentioned "temporal anomalies of structural graph changes" but didn't specify further, I've inferred a few common challenging use cases to start, but let's dive deeper if you have a specific aspect you're particularly concerned about (e.g., node-level attribute anomalies or edge-pattern-based anomalies). 

The LLM interfaces, especially for this domain, would also greatly benefit from domain-specific ontologies or lexicons (e.g., knowing common network components, services, states, etc.) to tailor explanations and a more natural interaction. Would you consider adding a step to incorporate or generate domain-specific vocabulary or use pre-trained models adapted with network terminology? 

If you could share more about the typical interactions engineers or operators have with the graph (what they analyze for, their questions, etc.), it could inform the LLM's design to provide more useful, actionable insights. 

Let me know which part you'd like to focus next or if there's a specific implementation detail (e.g., start with GCNs or a simpler time-series approach first) to drill into!

Based on the team's feedback and the challenges mentioned, here's a concise, bullet-point advice list as a domain expert:

### 1. **Sanity Check & Model Validation**

* Validate the model's outputs against manually validated data to ensure accuracy and relevance.
* Use data visualization for qualitative checks (e.g., networkX, Plotly, to see patterns) over specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
* Consider A/B testing approach: compare model's flagged anomalies to manual inspection outcomes to refine the model's confidence and specificity.

### 2. **LLM & Natural Language Outputs**

* **Domain Familiar Input Language**: Ensure the LLM is trained (or fine-tuned) on domain-specific terminology, network operations texts, or tutorials to understand jargon.
* **Transform Outputs into Insights**: Use LLM to provide contextual explanations for the anomaly score numbers, e.g., "Scores above 0.7 in critical nodes usually indicate service issues, especially if they correlate with network latency spikes or specific device IDs."
* **Example of LLM Usage**: For each anomaly output, ask the LLM to "Explain [anomaly output] in network engineering terms for [specific node/edge type]."
* **Examples of Embedding Explained**: For node/edge embeddings, if the model flags a node as anomalous, ask the LLM to explain **"Why this node's embedded representation suggests it is behaving unusually?"**.

### 3. **Interactive Visualization with a Slider**

* Design a visualization showing:
  * **Time-series graph views** to highlight anomalies visually.
  * **Slider for datetime navigation**: let users explore snapshots over time.
  * **Filtering options** like:
    - Anomaly type (node/edge/graph pattern).
    - Severity levels based on model output.
  * **Feature highlighting**: Both color, size, and LLM-generated explanations for each highlighted anomaly.
* **Use Case**: Engineers can compare snapshots side-by-side or see how anomalies evolve over time, with explanations from the LLM to drive deeper investigation.

### 4. **Node2Vec and Temporal Graph Embeddings**

* **Node2Vec Use Case**: 
  - Suitable for creating static graph representations (node and edge embeddings).
  - To apply to temporal data, consider either converting time-series snapshots into static graphs preserving node types/labels and edge categories or:
    - Use an approach like **Dynamic Node2Vec** or **TGuess**, which can handle evolving graphs by comparing embeddings across time or creating temporal embeddings.
  - Look into **temporal graph convolutional networks (TGCN)** which naturally handle evolving graphs.
* **Comparison Strategy**:
  1. Generate embeddings for each snapshot.
  2. Compare them using metrics like cosine similarity, L2 norm, or Mahalanobis distance over time to detect drift or outlier structures.
  3. Flag substantial differences between snapshots (e.g., too big of a change in a critical node's relative position across snapshots).

### 5. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Temporal Datasets**

* **Timely Considerations**:
  - **Graphs over Time**: GNNs, especially models like **GraphSAGE**, **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**, or **Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (TGCNs)**, are designed for dynamic datasets.
  - **Dataset Strategy**:
    1. Create temporal graphs: Each snapshot is a subgraph (or an S matrix with timestamps).
    2. Use GNN to process each snapshot in sequence, preserving node/node gradient relationships or evolving features over time.
  - **Model Choice**:
    - GATs work well for node/edge attribution (why anomalies) and can be extended for temporal analysis.
    - For clarity: 
      - If changes across snapshots over short intervals, might not need full TCNs, but for complex, interpretive tasks, such as attribution, GNNs usually suffice.
      - For very large, high-frequency data (like real-time), see if you can offload to pre-aggregated features or justifying TCNs if their added complexity is justified.

### 6. **Understanding Graph Structure & Rules**

* **Process with Labeled Edge Types**: 
  - If sources and destinations are interchangeable (e.g., reversible flows), ensure your analysis:
    - Does not falsely flag flipping patterns as anomolous.
    - Can reason about **topology independence**.
  - Ask the LLM: "What edge types commonly proxy for reversibility in our network and should we normalize for those differently during analysis?"

* **Visual Exploration**:
  - Use [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), or similar tools tailored for undirectedness or to emphasize directionality if important.
  - **Automatic Layouts**: Try different layouts (e.g., circular, force-directed) to highlight structural patterns over time.

* **Data Rules Defining":
  - **Use Graph Algorithms**: For finding community structures, centrality shifts, or connectivity patterns. Explain these results to the LLM to cross-validate assumptions.
  - **Add Domain Knowledge to Rules**: Define rules based on industry practice (e.g., "When two nodes alternate roles in connectivity unexpectedly over short time, this might indicate protocol issues").
  *   Ask your LLM: "Based on these changes in connectivity reports across snapshots, what natural network structures or rules can explain this pattern of role reversal without being suspicious?"

### Key Takeaways:
- **Validate & Learn Fast**: Quick experiments with validation and visualization to refine the models and the LLM's explanation layer.
- **Leverage Interactivity & LLM**: For explaining what numerical or structural outputs mean to engineers in their own terms.
- **Choose Models Based on Need**: Simple (but well-tuned) GNNs might suffice for the embedded similarity task, and a LSTM/TGNN if evolving patterns over micro-time need to be captured.
- **Always Combine Human & AI Strengths**: Manual scrutiny for validation, AI for scale and pattern finding, human oversight for judgment on anomaly outputs.

If we can focus on one first (say, building out the interactive visualization with LLM hooks, then iterating through the modeling pipeline), that might reduce complexity in the early stages. Let me know if you want elaboration on any specific bullet or approach! 

Given the amount of data (200M+ nodes), optimizing the LLM for scale (perhaps fine-tuned on network texts if thereâ€™s a suitable corpus) or using cloud-based LLM services with scalability could be crucial.
